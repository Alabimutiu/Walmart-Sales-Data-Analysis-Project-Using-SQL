# üõçÔ∏è Walmart Sales Data Analysis Project

This project explores transactional sales data from a Walmart store using **Advanced SQL queries** to extract business insights. The dataset consists of 1,000 rows and 14 columns, simulating typical retail transactions, and was analyzed with a focus on sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following features:

- `Invoice ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction
- `Branch`: Store branch (A, B, or C)
- `City`: City where the branch is located
- `Customer Type`: Member or Normal
- `Gender`: Male or Female
- `Product Line`: Category of product sold
- `Unit Price`: Price per unit of product
- `Quantity`: Number of items purchased
- `Tax 5%`: VAT collected on purchase
- `Total`: Total amount (including tax)
- `Date`: Date of transaction
- `Time`: Time of transaction
- `Payment`: Payment method used
- `Rating`: Customer satisfaction rating (scale of 1‚Äì10)

## üéØ Business Problems Addressed

1. **Branch Performance:** Which branches generate the most revenue?
2. **Product Profitability:** What are the best and worst-performing product lines?
3. **Customer Behavior:** How do members differ from normal customers in spending?
4. **Gender Insights:** Do men or women spend more, and on what?
5. **Sales Trends:** When are peak shopping hours and days?
6. **Payment Preferences:** What methods of payment are most preferred?
7. **Customer Satisfaction:** What do ratings reveal about service and product quality?

## üìä Key Insights from the Data

### üè™ Branch & City Analysis
- **Branch B** recorded the **highest total sales**, indicating a larger customer base or better-performing location.
- **Yangon** was the top-performing city.

### üì¶ Product Line Performance
- **Electronic Accessories** and **Food & Beverages** were consistently top-selling categories.
- **Health & Beauty** had high customer ratings but lower total sales.

### üë• Customer Segmentation
- **Member customers** tend to spend more per transaction than Normal customers.
- Both genders are nearly equally represented, but **female customers** had slightly higher average purchase totals.

### ‚è∞ Time & Day Trends
- Peak hours were between **13:00 and 15:00**, coinciding with lunchtime and early afternoon shopping.
- **Saturdays and Sundays** recorded higher average sales.

### üí≥ Payment Method Trends
- **Ewallet** was the most frequently used method, followed by **Cash**.
- **Credit card** usage was the least common.

### ‚≠ê Customer Feedback
- Average rating across all transactions was around **7 out of 10**.
- **Branch C** had the **most consistent ratings** (lowest standard deviation), suggesting consistent service quality.
